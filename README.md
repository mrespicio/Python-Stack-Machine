# Python-Stack-Machine
<b>Date:</b> December 2018 </br>
Assignment for programming languages class. Designed to familiarize myself with python and implementation of a stack machine. Consists of 3 parts. </br>

<b>Prog4_1:</b>Takes a single command line argument, which is the name of a text file. Program reads file and tokenizes each word and prints them separated by a comma. </br>
<b>StackMachine:</b> Contains 8 member functions - push, pop, add, sub, mul, div and mod.  </br>
<b>Prog4_2:</b> Tokenizes a text file simiarly to prog4_1. If there are two tokens and the first token is "push" and the second is a number, it will push that number onto the StackMachine. If there is one token and it is one of the functions of the StackMachine, it will call that function. </br>
